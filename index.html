										<h2><a href="#">Choco de Luxe – Sales Performance Analysis
Objective

									<p>For this project, I used Tableau to analyze Choco de Luxe’s sales performance across locations, channels, products, and salespeople. My goal was to uncover actionable insights that support profitable growth and operational efficiency.

Key findings include:

Top Locations & Channels: High-performing locations like Piedmont and leading channels such as the Website show that strong execution paired with market reach drives results.

Opportunities for Improvement: Some locations and channels generate revenue but lag in delivery efficiency or profitability, highlighting areas for better logistics and cost control.

Workforce Insights: Profit targets can be met even with lower sales volumes when salespeople focus on high-margin products and pricing discipline, emphasizing the need to align incentives and training with profitability objectives.

Product Performance: Non-organic products drive most revenue, while organic products, despite lower volumes, deliver higher margins and support premium positioning.

The Tableau dashboards I developed provide business leaders with an intuitive, visual way to track performance, optimize strategy, and make data-driven decisions.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Brewing Business Success: Café Harmony Analysis in Micro-Soft Excel<br />

									<p>Using Excel, I analyzed Café Harmony’s sales and operations data to uncover trends, identify performance gaps, and highlight growth opportunities. The project revealed key insights on product performance, location efficiency, and customer behavior, which informed actionable recommendations:

Customer Experience

Introduce a loyalty program with points, discounts, and free drinks

Collect regular customer feedback and act on it quickly

Personalize offers (e.g., favorite drinks, birthday specials)

Menu & Product Performance

Focus on top-selling items and promote them

Remove underperforming items to reduce waste

Stock Management

Build relationships with suppliers for quick restocking

Track inventory to prevent shortages of popular products

Employee & Location Performance

Reward high-performing staff with incentives

Provide training for underperforming staff

Share best practices across top-performing locations

Use sales data to set clear performance targets

This analysis transformed raw data into actionable insights, equipping Café Harmony with strategies to improve efficiency, boost customer satisfaction, and drive profitability.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS INSIGHT
 using SQL<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Screenshot 2026-01-09 230044.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, I used SQL to extract, clean, and analyze employee performance, retention, and compensation data to generate actionable HR insights. My analysis revealed that Marketing and Engineering had the highest turnover, suggesting workload, engagement, or growth challenges. I also identified 71 employees scoring below 3.5, highlighting areas for targeted coaching, while 9 high performers scored a perfect 5.0, indicating key talent worth retaining.

The compensation review showed a total salary expense of ₦4.85M, with performance generally linked to pay, though inconsistencies exist across departments.

Key Recommendations:

Strengthen retention with targeted surveys and engagement programs

Boost performance through mentorship, training, and goal-setting initiatives

Reward excellence with bonuses, promotions, or recognition programs

Ensure fair compensation via regular salary reviews

Adopt data-driven HR strategies to track retention, performance, and pay equity

This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL to turn raw HR data into actionable insights, helping organizations improve employee engagement, retention, and overall workforce performance..</p>
